This is the difference between a successful endeavor and a not so much one. Persistence of the author. Persistence is one of the cornerstone personality traits that can guarantee success in any area.
Persistence is the decisive quality when the others are present in more or less sufficient quantity. Imagine - 2 persons embarking on similar projects. 

**Person O** - lacks sufficient persistence. They can work on the project for a couple of days, but then either gradually or suddenly loose interest or find excuses to pursue another project.

**Person P** - has enough persistence and considers that it is very important to bring projects to their logical conclusion. They can persist and continue working on the project until it is either launched and is a success, or launched and turns out to be a failure. They might be a bit stubborn - even if all the feedback from the ongoing work shows that the project is likely to fail, even if all people around them may suggest that they should stop working on the project, they continue work. They hate unfinished work. Even after a failed launch, they will continue to persist. This might prove even more critical than in the previous phases - pre release. Because there are sufficient examples where project were not successful for many years before eventually becoming big successes (reasons for these might be maturity of the market, or a small change in either the product itself or in people's perception).

I think this is one of the most important qualities to be trained in children and adults.

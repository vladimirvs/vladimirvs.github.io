I think every human's personality can be viewed from a tridimensional perspective.
The dimensions are:

1. Industriousness
2. Courage
3. Intelligence

Each person can be describe as having a ratio of all these 3. For a man to become a great achiever, it is
necessary that they posess all 3 of these in sufficient quantity. Although in many cases the presence of only 2
could be compensated by Luck. To note Luck is not a quality. Luck is just a favourable conjuncture of
circumstances. Luck not being a quality cannot be cultivated and is not constant therefore it cannot be relied upon.

Therefore posessing only 2 of the qualities can lead to high achivement only sporadically.

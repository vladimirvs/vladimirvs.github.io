I think every human's personality can be viewed from a tridimensional perspective.
The dimensions are:

1. Industriousness
2. Courage
3. Intelligence

Each person can be describe as having a ratio of all these 3. For a man to become a great achiever, it is
necessary that they posess all 3 of these in sufficient quantity. Although in many cases the presence of only 2
could be compensated by Luck. To note Luck is not a quality. Luck is just a favourable conjuncture of
circumstances. Luck not being a quality cannot be cultivated and is not constant therefore it cannot be relied upon.

Therefore posessing only 2 of the qualities can lead to high achivement only sporadically.

The ratio of these qualities could be seen as a polar diagram. 

Examples

A person is industrious and intelligent but lacks courage - will not achieve great things because of social impediments. These types can have a good isolated research career.

A person is smart and curageous but lazy - lacks constancy can have some random achievements which don't see continuation.

A person is industrious and curageous but not very intelligent - the energetic type, but gets in trouble often by being sucked in various illegal activities and often ends up in prison or dead before their time.

When a person has only 1 of the qualities in sufficient amount, the situation is worse.

So what to do?

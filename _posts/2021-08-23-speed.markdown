SPEED
=====

Speed is the important factor that always pops out in successful stories - from Alexander the Great, to Napoleon, to any modern business success! It is SPEED! In all these cases, the protagonists manifested unprecedented speed of action. Alexander always surprised his enemies by quickly attacking and never waiting for the right circumstances. Napoleon, became emperor in several years. In a span of a year he became from nothing - one of the greatest generals - sent to rule the Army of Italy. 
There are never right circumstances. The circumstances are created by people. If you want to become someone's slave, wait for the right circumstances and you will swirl in their circumstances, in their tornado of energy.
They say - luck is when preparation meets the opportunity. Only fools wait for luck! 
Fast! No waiting, no time! Do things properly, take your time to do them properly. But act quickly! Make your mind and act quickly! No waiting. No relaxation!
Run faster! Combat the entropy, combat the decay and death. Move fast and do whatever is necessary to achieve your plans. Don't wait for the right opportunity. Create the opportunity.
Act Now!

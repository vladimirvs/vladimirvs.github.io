*If you are not feeling stupid, you are not learning anything.*

Realizing how stupid one is, is of great value because it means 2 things - 1 is that you actually learn something new or you realize that your previous knowledge is far from sufficient or is just incorrect. 2 - is that it motivates you to learn more and humbles you.

Reading "news", you rarely feel stupid. In fact, it's the opposite - when you are reading news you are feeling much smarter than the protagonists. You see how people get into "stupid" accidents, you see how people get to be drug addicts, how people are homeless, are hit by war - and you feel so comfortable, so much smarter and thinking that those things could never happen to you. And so on... That's why, by reading news to become smarter, you are not becoming smarter. Although specialized news - science, economy, some specific topics could help you become smarter. 



*If something is easy to do, it is not worth doing it.*

Any learning is hard, any activity worth doing is hard by definition. Otherwise, all would do it and it's value would diminish. Let's say - playing piano. If it were easy to learn to play, everyone would be a virtuoso. But it is not easy and it might be worth doing it. On the other hand, all the leisure activities are easy (by definition again), therefore there is little benefit from those activities, except for the actual relaxation benefit - but then the best leisure activity should be sleep!
